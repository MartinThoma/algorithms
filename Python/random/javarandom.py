    An implementation of the Java SE 6 random number generator.

    Java's RNG is based on a classic Knuth-style linear congruential formula,

    http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Random.html. This
    makes it quite trivial to reimplement and port to other platforms.

    This class should be bit-for-bit compatible with any Java RNG.

    This class is not thread-safe. For deterministic behavior, lock or
    synchronize all accesses to this class per-instance.
